# Nutrify 

 Nutrify helps users find recipes based on diet restrictions and preferences, providing them with a multitude of options to meet their goals. The app uses flask and the Edamam API to search for recipes based on nutrient quantity (low sodium, high protein, etc) and recipe ingredients. Users can save recipes and analyze the nutritional components of a recipe, as well as modify servings to understand how the quantity increases the amount of a nutrient in their diet. Nutrify uses Chart.js to visualize how the amount of a nutrient in a recipe impacts a user's goal.
